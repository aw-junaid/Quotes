# Under peaceful conditions, the warlike man attacks himself.

> Authentic strength emanates from those who exude unwavering confidence without seeking validation from others. Liberated from the need to prove themselves, they embody resilience and self-assurance with every move they make.

> If you can get a mental image of the person you would most like to become, begin now to act as that person would act in everything you do. Gradually, imperceptibly, you will actually become that person. It goes back to what the great German poet and philosopher Goethe once said: before you can do something, you must first be something. Before you can do what you would most like to do, you must first become the person who could do it. A woman cooking dinner has only to act like a great chef to turn out a better meal. The student who begins to act like a top student will begin to get better grades. You can even look much better by simply acting like the person you would most like to look like and be like. The secret is to get and hold fast in your mind the mental image of the person you would most like to be. Then, in every situation, you act and talk as you feel that person would. You make the kind of decisions you think that person would. This is the way to constantly grow into a better, more effective person.  Remember, the journey to becoming your best self begins with a single step. - Earl Nightingale

Strange, isn’t it?
You know yourself better than anyone else, yet you crumble at the words of someone who hasn’t even lived a second of your life.
The world is filled with people who think they know you. Listen to your own voice. Only you can tell if it aligns with what you want or not. Because it’s funny “You’re all you have and you never even learned to like yourself at all.
Isn’t it funny though how everyone had a different perception of you in their mind. But everyone expects you to be responsible for each of those perceptions they have created for you in their heads. Yet when you begin to ignore these perceptions it seems like it’s an issue even though you’re just being you. Each version of you has their own cycles of life and death. You may ‘Die’ in somebody else’s heart, just like how you are ‘born’ when you meet someone new.
