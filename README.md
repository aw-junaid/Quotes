# Under peaceful conditions, the warlike man attacks himself.

> Authentic strength emanates from those who exude unwavering confidence without seeking validation from others. Liberated from the need to prove themselves, they embody resilience and self-assurance with every move they make.

> If you can get a mental image of the person you would most like to become, begin now to act as that person would act in everything you do. Gradually, imperceptibly, you will actually become that person. It goes back to what the great German poet and philosopher Goethe once said: before you can do something, you must first be something. Before you can do what you would most like to do, you must first become the person who could do it. A woman cooking dinner has only to act like a great chef to turn out a better meal. The student who begins to act like a top student will begin to get better grades. You can even look much better by simply acting like the person you would most like to look like and be like. The secret is to get and hold fast in your mind the mental image of the person you would most like to be. Then, in every situation, you act and talk as you feel that person would. You make the kind of decisions you think that person would. This is the way to constantly grow into a better, more effective person.  Remember, the journey to becoming your best self begins with a single step. - Earl Nightingale

<blockquote> Strange, isn’t it?
You know yourself better than anyone else, yet you crumble at the words of someone who hasn’t even lived a second of your life.
The world is filled with people who think they know you. Listen to your own voice. Only you can tell if it aligns with what you want or not. Because it’s funny “You’re all you have and you never even learned to like yourself at all.
Isn’t it funny though how everyone had a different perception of you in their mind. But everyone expects you to be responsible for each of those perceptions they have created for you in their heads. Yet when you begin to ignore these perceptions it seems like it’s an issue even though you’re just being you. Each version of you has their own cycles of life and death. You may ‘Die’ in somebody else’s heart, just like how you are ‘born’ when you meet someone new. </blockquote>

> The brave man is he who overcomes not only his enemies but his pleasures.

> You will never know who I am in reality because the depth of my existence exceeds the limit of your understanding.

> The cruelest way to hurt someone is to win their heart and then leave, leaving them torn between despair and insanity.

> Control, it's all about control. Every dictatorship has one obsession and that's it. In ancient Rome they gave the people bread and circuses. They kept population busy with entertainment but other dictatorships used other strategies to control ideas, the knowledge... how do they do that? Lower education, they limit culture, censor information, they censor any means of individual expression and it is important to remember this, that this is a pattern, that repeats itself throughout history.

> Man suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for fun. The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves. Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.  the secret of life — to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.

> When integrity falters, trust crumbles,Leaving friendships hanging by a thread. Handle trust with care, for it's the fabric that binds. In the intricate tapestry of friendships, trust forms the sturdy threads that bind souls together. It's a delicate balance, easily disrupted by the slightest breach of integrity. Once trust is compromised, the very foundation upon which the friendship is built begins to tremble. Like a fragile fabric, even the strongest bond can unravel when integrity is called into question. Every word, action, and choice carries the weight of maintaining this sacred trust. It's a solemn responsibility to honor the integrity of our connections, for when trust is broken, it's not just a fracture in the relationship but a wound to the soul. Therefore, let us nurture and safeguard the trust bestowed upon us, cherishing the strength it brings to our friendships and understanding that it's the cornerstone upon which lasting bonds are built.
