> Infinite sequences aren’t just abstract mathematical concepts; they are woven into the fabric of our world. Starting from a simple shape, like a triangle, and expanding endlessly into complex patterns, these sequences appear in nature as spirals in shells, the branching of trees, and the arrangement of leaves. In architecture, ancient monuments and Islamic tilework employ infinite patterns to symbolize eternity and unity. Even in art, these sequences create mesmerizing designs, reflecting the boundless possibilities of repetition. Whether in nature, architecture, or art, infinite sequences connect everything, revealing the underlying order and beauty of the universe.

> A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operates by applying filters to input data, extracting features through convolution and pooling layers. These filters systematically scan the input, detecting patterns like edges. The network learns these filters during training, enabling it to recognize complex features in images. By combining convolution and pooling layers, CNNs create feature maps that highlight detected features. This process allows CNNs to excel in image and video analysis, offering robustness to variations like translation and rotation.

> ☀️Our sun might appear yellow, but it’s actually a dazzling white! The culprit behind the color change is Earth’s atmosphere. Sunlight carries a whole spectrum of colors, like a rainbow. But as it travels through the air, tiny molecules scatter blue light more efficiently than red light. This scattered blue light is what paints the sky blue. The remaining sunlight, with less blue, reaches our eyes with a slightly yellow tint. This is similar to how a prism separates white light into its colors – the sun emits all the colors at once, our atmosphere just filters some out! Astronauts in space see the sun’s true white light, but here on Earth, we get a yellow appearance of the Sun due to the phenomenon of atmospheric scattering.
