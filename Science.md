> Infinite sequences arenâ€™t just abstract mathematical concepts; they are woven into the fabric of our world. Starting from a simple shape, like a triangle, and expanding endlessly into complex patterns, these sequences appear in nature as spirals in shells, the branching of trees, and the arrangement of leaves. In architecture, ancient monuments and Islamic tilework employ infinite patterns to symbolize eternity and unity. Even in art, these sequences create mesmerizing designs, reflecting the boundless possibilities of repetition. Whether in nature, architecture, or art, infinite sequences connect everything, revealing the underlying order and beauty of the universe.
